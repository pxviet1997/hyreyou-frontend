# Hyre You

The main reason to build this application is to connect the Talent looking for job opportunities with Business. While building such an application it is necessary to keep the user experience in mind. Talent could seamlessly add and update their personal Information, Educational details, skills etc. Easier for Business to create Job Roles and get Talent matched automatically. An algorithm will do this matching behind the scenes.
